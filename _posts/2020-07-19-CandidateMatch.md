As I go through the WA Voter's Pamphlet, I realized how absurd our system for selecting our candidates actually are. I have no idea about how well a candidate matches my values. In fact, I haven't actually organized my values against all of the potential issues. I propose something like an e-Harmony service to help match people with candidates. I see a system like this:

1) A person is given a budget of 100.0 political points to apply to issues/stances that they care about. They select through all of the political positions and apply their values and afford their budget. They must use all of their points. This can have a anonymous option.
2) Each candidate must fill out their position with 100.0 political points.  They must use all of their points.
3) An algorithm matches people to candidates based on shared values. It identifies areas where their is alignment and differences. This should help people vote according to their alignment to political concerns, and weed out the hype and meaningless statements.

Of course, this would mean voters and candidates would need to be required to fill this out. But as I see this, this would be the best way to support voters in having their values represented in the candidates. This would require that all candidates fill out this information and that it be made public. Use of the system by voters would be optional.

It would be an interesting experiment to do this at the city level.
