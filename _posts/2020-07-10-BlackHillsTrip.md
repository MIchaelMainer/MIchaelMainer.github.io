# The Mainer Family 2020 road trip to the Black Hills and the Badlands in South Dakota

We cancelled our yearly family reunion trip to Cabo San Lucas. We couldn't visit family with COVID-19 so we decided last minute to head east to the Black Hills
of South Dakota. This was the first time driving through the northern United States so we were excited to see what this great country had to offer. This was our 
first attempt at a week long RV trip so we expect it will set the standard for future RV trips. 

## Jumpstart to Fishtrap, WA

We decided we'd leave immeditiately after work on Friday, July 10th. We planned on boondocking over night at Fishtrap, WA so that we could get a headstart 
on our roadtrip. It was our first boondocking experience in the RV. Fishtrap is Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land which allows for 
'[dispersed camping](https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/camping)' which means free. 


## Introduction to Montana and the Yellowstone teaser

Pine Creek Campground
Sounds of rushing water
A quick dinner over a fire and smores.
The beauty of the yellowstone river valley, the ranches, 
Bark beetles.
Cool drive up.
Trying out the panorama feature on our phone. THe handoff.
Driving out and loving the landscapes of Montana and the fast highways. It evokes romatic images of living in the rural west.

## Black Hills of South Dakota

Arrived - let the kids ride their bikes. Setup and relax. Loved the premixed drinks from Costco. 
No breaking social distancing. Gave the boys a choice. Proud of them.
About Palmer Gulch.

day 1 - Went to center lake.
We found wild raspberries on the dam, Troy and I ate a lot and then brought some back for the family.
Vincent got cut on the rocks.
Tried out my new inflatable kayak. The kids used borrowed kayaks.
We drove Needles highway - amazing drive through 
The boys were amazed at the shiny minerals in the rocks. All of the rocks look like they have big pieces of glitter.
We wanted to go to Sylvain lake, crazy busy, didn't feel comfortable going there.

day 2 - Wildlife loop and revisit Needles highway, Sylvain Lake
The boys wanted to go rock climbing on day 1 but only had sandles so we set aside time for them to go rock climbing along the Needles high way.
We then went to the wildlife loop. We saw Bison and prarie dogs. 
Walked around Sylvain lake. Saw someone catch a nice trout there. Beautiful little lake. 

## Bear Country and the Badlands

Our third day, we left the Black Hills. We got out early in hopes that we could avoid the crowds on our way to Bear Country. Bear Country is like Tiger.

## Drive back

## Looking back
- No COVID19 - we stayed away from lots of places and people. The Black Hills are a popular vacation spot so we couldn't do as much as we wanted
as we tried to maintain social distancing guidelines.



2451 miles round trip.
