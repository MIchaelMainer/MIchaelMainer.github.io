# The Mainer Family 2020 road trip to the Black Hills and the Badlands in South Dakota

We cancelled our yearly family reunion trip to Cabo San Lucas. We couldn't visit family with COVID-19 so we decided last minute to head east to the Black Hills
of South Dakota. This was the first time driving through the northern United States so we were excited to see what this great country had to offer. This was our 
first attempt at a week long RV trip so we expect it will set the standard for future RV trips. 

## Jumpstart to Fishtrap, WA

We decided we'd leave immeditiately after work on Friday, July 10th. We planned on boondocking over night at [Fishtrap, WA](https://www.blm.gov/visit/fishtrap-recreation-area) so that we could get a headstart on our roadtrip.

It was our first boondocking experience in the RV. Fishtrap is Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land which allows for 
'[dispersed camping](https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/camping)' which means free. Manija was concerned about not being in a designated campground, but I think she's fine with it now. We got there late so we parked and went to sleep. The next morning, we drove around Fishtrap to get a better lay of the place. I now know where I'll stay if we just want a quick sleep spot, or whether we may want to stay in actual campsite. We stayed at the large trailhead parking lot by Watermelon Hill. Next time, if we plan to quickly get out the next morning, we'd like to try to stay at the much smaller lot west of Fishtrap Resort. It has paved access and is faster to get in or out. If we had more time to explore, we may stay at one of the spots by Hog Lake.

On our way out, I think I saw a Marten but I can't be sure. There were two of them and they ran off before we got close. 

## Introduction to Montana and the Yellowstone teaser



Pine Creek Campground
Sounds of rushing water
A quick dinner over a fire and smores.
The beauty of the yellowstone river valley, the ranches, 
Bark beetles.
Cool drive up.
Trying out the panorama feature on our phone. The handoff.
Driving out and loving the landscapes of Montana and the fast highways. It evokes romatic images of living in the rural west.

## Black Hills of South Dakota

Arrived - let the kids ride their bikes. Setup and relax. Loved the premixed drinks from Costco. 
No breaking social distancing. Gave the boys a choice. Proud of them.
About Palmer Gulch.

day 1 - Went to center lake.
We found wild raspberries on the dam, Troy and I ate a lot and then brought some back for the family.
Vincent got cut on the rocks.
Tried out my new inflatable kayak. The kids used borrowed kayaks.
We drove Needles highway - amazing drive through 
The boys were amazed at the shiny minerals in the rocks. All of the rocks look like they have big pieces of glitter.
We wanted to go to Sylvain lake, crazy busy, didn't feel comfortable going there.

day 2 - Wildlife loop and revisit Needles highway, Sylvain Lake
The boys wanted to go rock climbing on day 1 but only had sandles so we set aside time for them to go rock climbing along the Needles high way.
We then went to the wildlife loop. We saw Bison and prarie dogs. 
Walked around Sylvain lake. Saw someone catch a nice trout there. Beautiful little lake. 

## Bear Country and the Badlands

Our third day, we left the Black Hills. We got out early in hopes that we could avoid the crowds on our way to Bear Country. Bear Country is like Tiger King's place, but the animals didn't live in cages, roamed around a lot, and generally looked better, well, for some sense of better for a wild anumal in captivity. We got to see bears, wolves, big horn sheep, prong-horn antelope, 

## Drive back

## Looking back
- No COVID19 - we stayed away from lots of places and people. The Black Hills are a popular vacation spot so we couldn't do as much as we wanted
as we tried to maintain social distancing guidelines.



2451 miles round trip.
