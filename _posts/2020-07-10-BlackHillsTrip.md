# The Mainer Family 2020 road trip to the Black Hills and the Badlands in South Dakota

We cancelled our yearly family reunion trip to Cabo San Lucas. We couldn't visit family with COVID-19 so we decided last minute to head east to the Black Hills
of South Dakota. This was the first time driving through the northern United States so we were excited to see what this great country had to offer. This was our 
first attempt at a week long RV trip so we expect it will set the standard for future RV trips. 

## Jumpstart to Fishtrap, WA

We decided we'd leave immeditiately after work on Friday, July 10th. We planned on boondocking over night at Fishtrap, WA so that we could get a headstart 
on our roadtrip. It was our first boondocking experience in the RV. Fishtrap is Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land which allows for 
'[dispersed camping](https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/camping)' which means free.
