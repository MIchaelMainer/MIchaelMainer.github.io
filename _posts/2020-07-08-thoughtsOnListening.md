# My cousin the conservative, me the moderate becoming more progressive

I recently sent a text to my cousin wishing him a happy belated birthday. Of the course of us texting back and forth, we discovered that 
recent events, namely the resurgence of Black Lives Matter, had nudged him in a more conservative direction, and myself, into a more
progressive one. Our mutual reaction was, "interesting....". I proposed that we should talk. He, with hesitatation, agreed. I didn't know at
the time, but he had already had lost some relationships because of his views. His concern was real.

We spent some time talking to each other about why we felt the way we did. He described why he felt the way he did, and he made some valid
points. 


## Listing to the other

Cassie Jaye, in [Meeting the Enemy TEDx Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WMuzhQXJoY), talks about actually listening, and her personal 
challenges with actually listening to people who did not hold her world view. This is something most of us struggle with, albeit in an 
unconscious way.
