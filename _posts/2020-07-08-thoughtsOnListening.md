# My cousin the conservative, me the moderate becoming more progressive

I recently sent a text to my cousin wishing him a happy belated birthday. Of the course of us texting back and forth, we discovered that 
recent events, namely the resurgence of Black Lives Matter, had nudged him in a more conservative direction, and myself, into a more
progressive one. Our mutual reaction was, "interesting....". I proposed that we should talk. He, with hesitatation, agreed. I didn't know at
the time, but he had already had lost some relationships because of his views. His concern was real.

We spent some time talking to each other about why we felt the way we did. He described why he felt the way he did, and he made some valid
points. 


## Listing to the other

Cassie Jaye, in [Meeting the Enemy TEDx Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WMuzhQXJoY), talks about actually listening, and her personal 
challenges with actually listening to people who did not hold her world view. This is something most of us struggle with, albeit in an 
unconscious way.

## Joe Rogan +1494

Weinstein: Police brutality is a feature, not a bug. Polic need re-education, the system is broken. 
Opportunity is being hoarded.
I disagree with his sentiment about the threat of Marxism. 
Fantastic breakdown of the breaking down of the social structures of african slaves, and why they are in their place. The momentum of slavery still exists. Breaking families apart. The software program - kind of works.
Interesting point about the results of taking men out of the population and why non jailed men are not incentivized to help.
This is 

Ranked choice voting would allow us to vote our heart. This would allow us to vote for other people, non dems and republicans. His plan sucks to have two people, for left and right.

Lab leak - maybe, I don't trust China. No matter what, we can't trust China as a partner in this area. I'm not interested in his take on the source of this virus. I'd like to hear epidemiologists take.
His hypothesis that it came from lab -- remember, there are other coronaviruses. He does make it an interesting case. 

I like the idea of having a unity candidate pair.

Concerns about grant money -- I don't see why being honest about this would prevent them from getting grants. Don't buy this.

The entire shutdownstem doesn't seem like a real issue. There is a wider issue around disbelief of science.

His suspician of compromise in science. I'm sorry, there is too much to be gained -- someone will address his suspician of science
